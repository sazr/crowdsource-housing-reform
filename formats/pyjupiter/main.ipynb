    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A traditional list of immediate \"basic needs\" is food (including water), shelter and clothing.[3] Many modern lists emphasize the minimum level of consumption of \"basic needs\" of not just food, water, clothing and shelter, but also sanitation, education, and healthcare. Different agencies use different lists. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's be honest, things have changed in Australia, many Australians are struggling to fulfil the basic need of Shelter. This basic need is no longer as easy to obtain as it was. New difficulties and issues have arisen that previous generations never faced. \n",
    "\n",
    "Legislation and reform is required to address these new issues and give future generations the same shelter opportunities that previous ones had.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose is to articulate legislation and other actions that can be taken to make it easier, faster and less costly to secure rental accomodation or purchase a principal place of residence."

    "- Create a fairer environment for tenants \n",
    "- Provide rental stability and housing stability\n",
    "- Reduce the time and effort required to secure a rental\n",
    "- Address \"Too poor to buy a house, too rich to rent\"\n",
    "- Implement policies who's primary concern is making  property a basic need first and a money making vehicle second.\n",

    "### Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems currently faced by Australians seeking shelter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Choice between shelter or employment\" - Rental inspections are held during work hours 10am-4pm. REA's won't accept an application if you haven't viewed the property.\n",
    "- \"1980's Application Methods Only\" - REA's only accept paper application forms. Prospective tenants fill out an average of 16 applications before securing a rental. Requires printer availability, scanner, printer fees, physically drop in application.\n",
    "- Questions on rental applications that inaccurately negatively impact an applicants application \"Was your bond returned in full from your last tenancy\"\n",
    "- The hidden fee's of renting\n",
    "- The basic need of shelter in Australia is unstable: \n",
    "    - Only 6 month tenancies max\n",
    "    - Time required to attend applications\n",
    "    - Threat of bond fees means fear of using rental\n",
    "    - Moving requires alot of time, effort and money\n",
    "    - Doubling up of rent between ending one tenancy and beginning the next (2 weeks overlap).\n",
    "- Too poor to buy, too rich to rent\n",
    "- Tenants implicitly liable for house maintenance (remove palm fronds, remove grass clippings, clean awnings)\n",
    "- \"Even if you win, you loose\" - Power imbalance between tenants and the landlord/Property Manager. Even mechanisms to solve disputes can lead to indirect negative outcomes for the tenant. Possible to be abused.\n",
    "- Holding of bond open to abuse by property managers."

    "\n",
    "- These policies need criticism and input from technical people (politicians, bureaucrats, community members, etc.). \n",
    "- Create a website for this\n",
    "- Use a better suited medium rather than github\n",
    "- As of 24/10/2022 these policies have been created in a realpolitik manor with policies that use carrots rather than sticks. The reason for this is past Australian government reluctance to intervene in the property market for fear of affecting the property investors."
