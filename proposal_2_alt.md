## "Housing supply is there, just not being used" - 12 months CGT moratorium, 12 months tax refund and maintenance rebate for renting out a Deceased estate, Holiday rental, AirBnB rental, Holiday home or vacant house.


Example; Jane owns a house in Burrum Heads, QLD that she rents out as a holiday rental through a real estate agency. The house is usually only occupied 26 weeks out of the year. If Jane decides to rent the property on a regular fixed term lease she can claim a rebate sum of $2500 and a tax credit of $5000 over 2 years.


#### Stakeholders

- Investment Property Owners
- Renters
- State Government
- Federal Government
- Real Estate Agency


#### Proposal Details

- "12 months CGT moratorium, 12 months tax refund and maintenance rebate" rules and eligibility;
	- The IPO must provide a copy of a minimum 12 month fixed term lease agreement.
	- The IP is not eligible if the IPO has been leased on a fixed term lease within the last 6 months.
	- The IPO is not eligible if they have received proposal 1.
	- The IPO needs to declare what purpose the IP was used for in the last 12 momths or more and is only eligible if the purpose is any of the following:
		- Holiday rental
		- Holiday home
		- AirBnB
		- Occupied by a now deceased person
	- The IPO can only claim the tax refund and/or rebate if the IP is under an active fixed term lease. For example, Jane rents out her IPO for 12 months under a fixed term lease then decides not to continue renting the property under a fixed term lease but instead return to holiday renting. She can now no longer claim any tax refund even though she is within the 2 year window.
- The IPO can sell any investment asset and incur no CGT for 12 months after signing the fixed term lease and whilst the lease is active.
- The IPO can claim up to $2500 over 2 years for IP maintenance and repairs for 12 months after signing the fixed term lease and whilst the lease is active. 
- The IPO can claim a $5000 income tax credit that financial year for 12 months after signing the fixed term lease and whilst the lease is active. 


#### Impacts of proposal on stakeholders

**Postitive**

- Make renting out an investment property for fixed term leases more attractive and competitive vs other methods (holiday rental, AirBnB).
- Use existing properties to increase the supply of fixed term rentals and increase the supply faster than other options such as building (which takes time).
- 

**Negative**

- This proposal may not make renting their IP attractive enough. *Please suggest how this proposal can be improved to encourage IPO's to rent out their properties on fixed term leases*

#### Potential policy abusal

*We've seen how new policies can backfire and have \*unintended effects. It's best to identify policy abusals for this specific policy so we can mitigate them.*

\*In October 2022 the Queensland State Government implemented policies to that gives tenant's more negotiating power when renwing a lease. In response to the policy, the REIQ (Real Estate Institute of Queensland) recommended all landlords immediately issue RTA Form 20's "Notice to Leave" to their tenants and to issue Form 20's to tenants at the beginning of signing a new lease. By issuing Form 20's it almost nulifies the effects and benefits of the Queensland State Government's policy for tenants. We want to avoid such outcomes of the policies we are advocating.
