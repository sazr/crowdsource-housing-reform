## Low occupant to bedroom ratio tax - tax or limit tax deductions on households that have vacant rooms.


Example; Nigel and Lynn are retired empty nesters who earn about $65k a year (all tax free) in their SMSF and rental income from 2 IP's. They live in their PPOR 4 bedroom house that they raised their 3 children in and have fully paid off the mortgage on. Their children have since moved out and 3 bedrooms in their PPOR sit vacant. Because they have a low occupant to bedroom ratio their $65K SMSF earners incur tax and they cannot claim IP related deductions. 

SMSF - Self-managed super fund. In the retirement phase, in most cases investment earnings are not taxed (for balances up to $1.7 million). If you're still working (it's called being in the accumulation phase) and earning under $250,000, you can make contributions before tax at a rate of 15 per cent, instead of your marginal tax rate. These concessions largely favour high income earners, since the tax rate within super is flat, while the tax system outside super is progressive.

#### Potential policy abusal

*We've seen how new policies can backfire and have \*unintended effects. It's best to identify policy abusals for this specific policy so we can mitigate them.*

\*In October 2022 the Queensland State Government implemented policies to that gives tenant's more negotiating power when renwing a lease. In response to the policy, the REIQ (Real Estate Institute of Queensland) recommended all landlords immediately issue RTA Form 20's "Notice to Leave" to their tenants and to issue Form 20's to tenants at the beginning of signing a new lease. By issuing Form 20's it almost nulifies the effects and benefits of the Queensland State Government's policy for tenants. We want to avoid such outcomes of the policies we are advocating.
