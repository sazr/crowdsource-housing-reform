Example; John (LL, IPO) agrees to sign a 18 month lease with their current tenant Keith and Kiara and lock in the rental rate at $550 per week for 18 months. John is now eligable to claim a 12 months CGT moratorium, 12 months tax refund and maintenance rebate for renting.

#### Proposal Objectives

- Maintain existing stock of properties used for fixed-term rental purposes. Avoid properties that are currently fixed-term leasing from being sold or used for other purposes.


#### Proposal Details

- If a LL enters into a fixed-term agreement with a tenant and agrees to lock in the rental rate for X period they can claim lower CGT charges on a tiered basis based off the 'lock-in' period: 
	- If the LL agrees to Lock-in rent rate for 12 months they will only pay 40% CGT rather than 50% for 12 months (maximum $500k CGT claim).
	- If the LL agrees to Lock-in rent rate for over 12 months and less than 18 months they will only pay 30% CGT rather than 50% for 12 months (maximum $500k CGT claim).
	- If the LL agrees to Lock-in rent rate for over 18 months they will only pay 40% CGT rather than 25% for 12 months (maximum $500k CGT claim).

- If a LL enters into a fixed-term agreement with a tenant and that fixed term agreement is greater than 12 months they can claim lower CGT charges on a tiered basis based off the 'lock-in' period: 
	- If the LL agrees to a fixed-term agreeement for a period of 12 months they can claim $10k tax refund and $2500 maintenance rebate for renting
	- If the LL agrees to a fixed-term agreeement for a period of greater than 12 months and less than 18 months they can claim $18k tax refund and $5000 maintenance rebate for renting
	- If the LL agrees to a fixed-term agreeement for a period of greater than 18 months they can claim $25k tax refund and $6500 maintenance rebate for renting

#### Potential policy abusal

*We've seen how new policies can backfire and have \*unintended effects. It's best to identify policy abusals for this specific policy so we can mitigate them.*

\*In October 2022 the Queensland State Government implemented policies to that gives tenant's more negotiating power when renwing a lease. In response to the policy, the REIQ (Real Estate Institute of Queensland) recommended all landlords immediately issue RTA Form 20's "Notice to Leave" to their tenants and to issue Form 20's to tenants at the beginning of signing a new lease. By issuing Form 20's it almost nulifies the effects and benefits of the Queensland State Government's policy for tenants. We want to avoid such outcomes of the policies we are advocating.
