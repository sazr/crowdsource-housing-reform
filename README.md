### Purpose

"A traditional list of immediate "basic needs" is food (including water), shelter and clothing. Many modern lists emphasize the minimum level of consumption of "basic needs" of not just food, water, clothing and shelter, but also sanitation, education, and healthcare. Different agencies use different lists."

Let's be honest, things have changed in Australia, many Australians are struggling to fulfil the basic need of Shelter. This basic need is no longer as easy to obtain as it was. New difficulties and issues have arisen that previous generations never faced. 

Legislation and reform is required to address these new issues and give future generations the same shelter opportunities that previous ones had.

The purpose is to articulate legislation and other actions that can be taken to make it easier, faster and less costly to secure rental accomodation or purchase a principal place of residence.


### Policy Objectives

- Not reinvent the wheel - copy models of real estate markets that have a better balance between shelter and investment. For example the German Real Estate market.
- Implement policies who's primary concern is making  property a basic need first and a money making vehicle second.
- Create a fairer environment for tenants 
- Provide rental stability and housing stability
- Reduce the time and effort required to secure a rental
- Address "Too poor to buy a house, too rich to rent"
- Disincentivise housing as an investment. It should COST money to sit on an asset and do nothing with it.
- Pay for the policies by taxing SMSF's and modern 'landlord barrons'


#### Aconymns

- IP - Investment Property
- IPS - Investment Property Seller 
- IPB - Investment Property Buyer
- IPO - Investment Property Owner
- PPORS - Primary place of residence seller (any age)
- PPORB - Primary place of residence buyer (any age)
- NPPOR - A person of any age who owns no property - including no primary place if residence or investment properties.  
- NPPORB - A person of any age who owns no property - including no primary place if residence or investment properties - attempting to buy a PPOR property.
- PPORBU45 - Primary place of residence buyer who is under 45yo and owns no other property.
- PPORBO45 - Primary place of residence buyer who is over 45yo (can own other property).
- LL - Landlord - owner of a property they are renting out
- RA - Real Estate Agent
- PM - Property manager
- SG - State Government
- FG - Federal Government
- LI - Bank/Lending Institution
- CGT - Capital Gains Tax
- SMSF - Self-managed super fund. In the retirement phase, in most cases investment earnings are not taxed (for balances up to $1.7 million). If you're still working (it's called being in the accumulation phase) and earning under $250,000, you can make contributions before tax at a rate of 15 per cent, instead of your marginal tax rate. These concessions largely favour high income earners, since the tax rate within super is flat, while the tax system outside super is progressive.


### Problems

Problems currently faced by Australians seeking shelter:

- Purchasing a PPOR now costs 4, 8 sometimes 11 times your annual income. That wasn't always the case, previous generations would be paying a maximum of 4 times their annual income. 
- In many places in Australia you can no longer purchase a home on 1 income, let alone raise a family on 1 income. That wasn't always the case, previous generations could both purchase a home on 1.5 incomes (1 spouse full-time, 1 spouse part-time/casual) or even 1 income.
- There's been a significant increase in barriers to renting a dwelling that just didn't exist for previous generations. In 1990 you didn't need to provide payslips, car registration, medicare card number, birth certificate, rental ledgers, electricty invoices, work history, personal + work + rental references, etc. The usage and abuse of residential tenancy databases was not an issue for renters at that time.
- "Choice between shelter or employment" - Rental inspections are held during work hours 10am-4pm. REA's won't accept an application if you haven't viewed the property.
- "1980's Application Methods Only" - REA's only accept paper application forms. Prospective tenants fill out an average of 16 applications before securing a rental. Requires printer availability, scanner, printer fees, physically drop in application.
- Questions on rental applications that inaccurately negatively impact an applicants application "Was your bond returned in full from your last tenancy"
- The hidden fee's of renting
- The basic need of shelter in Australia is unstable: 
    - Only 6 month tenancies max
    - Time required to attend applications
    - Threat of bond fees means fear of using rental
    - Moving requires alot of time, effort and money
    - Doubling up of rent between ending one tenancy and beginning the next (2 weeks overlap).
- Too poor to buy, too rich to rent
- Tenants implicitly liable for house maintenance (remove palm fronds, remove grass clippings, clean awnings)
- "Even if you win, you loose" - Power imbalance between tenants and the landlord/Property Manager. Even mechanisms to solve disputes can lead to indirect negative outcomes for the tenant. Possible to be abused.
- Holding of bond open to abuse by property managers.


#### META:

- Obviously these proposals are incomplete - we require crowd sourcing to both flesh them out but also improve them so that they successfully achieve their intended objectives without indirect negative consequences.
- Obviously these proposals are not technical - again we require crowd sourcing to both flesh them out but also improve them so that they successfully achieve their intended objectives without indirect negative consequences.
- These policies need criticism and input from technical people (politicians, bureaucrats, community members, etc.). 
- We need graphic designers to create info-graphics for each policy that succinctly articulates what the policy is and its benefits. These can be distributed on social media, in physical form, etc.
- Create a website for these policies so its more approachable for non-tecnical people (as opposed to GitHub).
- Use a better suited medium for policy development rather than github
- As of 24/10/2022 these policies have been created in a realpolitik manor with policies that use carrots rather than sticks. The reason for this is past Australian government reluctance to intervene in the property market for fear of affecting the property investors.
- If you see *TODO* that means that section has yet to be implemented. Feel free to take over and contribute.
- If you see *META* that means there is some pertinent information related to policy development/building rather than the proposal details/outcomes/etc.
