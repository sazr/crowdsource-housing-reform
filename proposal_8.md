## Disallow rental application questions that inaccurately or negatively impact an applicants application.


Example; Rental application questions such as "Did you have your bond returned in full from your last tenancy?" should be disalllowed because it is common practice for property managers to to change out-going tenants cleaning/repair fee's for frivilous reasons &/or that actually fall under Landlord property maintenance obligations instead of tenant damage or uncleanliness.

\*In October 2022 the Queensland State Government implemented policies to that gives tenant's more negotiating power when renwing a lease. In response to the policy, the REIQ (Real Estate Institute of Queensland) recommended all landlords immediately issue RTA Form 20's "Notice to Leave" to their tenants and to issue Form 20's to tenants at the beginning of signing a new lease. By issuing Form 20's it almost nulifies the effects and benefits of the Queensland State Government's policy for tenants. We want to avoid such outcomes of the policies we are advocating.
