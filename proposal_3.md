#### Potential policy abusal

*We've seen how new policies can backfire and have \*unintended effects. It's best to identify policy abusals for this specific policy so we can mitigate them.*

\*In October 2022 the Queensland State Government implemented policies to that gives tenant's more negotiating power when renwing a lease. In response to the policy, the REIQ (Real Estate Institute of Queensland) recommended all landlords immediately issue RTA Form 20's "Notice to Leave" to their tenants and to issue Form 20's to tenants at the beginning of signing a new lease. By issuing Form 20's it almost nulifies the effects and benefits of the Queensland State Government's policy for tenants. We want to avoid such outcomes of the policies we are advocating.
